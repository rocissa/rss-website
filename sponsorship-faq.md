#### How does our sponsorship drawing work?
>
> To ensure a fair and transparent process, we use a random drawing system for sponsorship opportunities. Here’s how it works:
>
> **Join our Mailing List:** [https://www.rochestersecurity.org/sponsor-mailing-list/](https://www.rochestersecurity.org/sponsor-mailing-list/)
>
> This mailing list will receive informational emails regarding all sponsorship opportunities. (via MailChimp)
>
> **Submit Your Interest**
>
> Anyone interested in sponsoring through the drawing must complete a Google Form before the specified deadline.
>
> **Drawing Process**
>
> Once the Call For Sponsors submission period closes, we conduct a random drawing from all entries. This ensures that every interested sponsor has an equal chance of being selected, regardless of company size or how quickly they respond to the email. Please see below for more information on Diamond Sponsorship Selection.
>
> Being open to more sponsorship levels will increase your chances of securing a spot, as there are a limited number of sponsorships available at each level. Please be sure to include all the levels you are willing to accept, as you can only be selected in the drawing if the level(s) you specify are still available. If you list only one level, you will only be considered for that level. 
>
> **Notification & Next Steps**
>
> Selected sponsors will be notified promptly and given details on how to proceed with their sponsorship. <u>*Completing payment of the invoice ASAP is key to having better priority for things like booth location and (for Platinums) sponsored-track presentations.*</u> If a selected sponsor is unable to participate, we will draw an alternate from the remaining wait-listed entries.
>
> This approach helps level the playing field and ensures a fair opportunity for all potential sponsors.
>

#### How does the Diamond Sponsorship drawing work?
>
> The Diamond Sponsorship Drawing is a two-step process that provides an opportunity for Platinum-level sponsors to be upgraded to a Diamond Sponsor through a random selection. Here’s how it works:
>
> 1. **Become a Platinum Sponsor and indicate your interest in Diamond**
>
>    There is a spot on the Call For Sponsors form that you must use to indicate interest in Diamond. To be part of the Diamond Sponsorship Drawing, you must first be selected and complete payment for a Platinum-Level Sponsorship.
> 	
> 2. **Second Random Drawing**
>
>    Once all relevant Platinum sponsorship payments are received, we will conduct a second random drawing to determine which of the interested Platinum sponsors will be upgraded to Diamond Sponsor.
> 
>
> This process gives all interested Platinum sponsors an equal chance at securing the sole Diamond Sponsorship.
>

#### Can I get a list of previous year's attendees?
>
> No, we do not share attendee lists from previous years, as access to this information is an exclusive benefit for our paid sponsors. However, you can review our website for summarized attendance trends, audience demographics, past sponsors, and other relevant event details to help inform your decision. 
> 

#### Can I share my sponsorship slot with another organization?
>
> Yes! Selected sponsors are welcome to partner with another organization or share their sponsorship slot. However, to ensure smooth communication and coordination, we require one individual or company to serve as the primary point of contact. This designated contact will be responsible for handling all sponsorship-related communications, logistics, and commitments on behalf of both parties.
>
> If you plan to share your sponsorship, please notify us in advance and confirm the details of the designated point of contact.
>

#### What is included with my booth?
> 
> Each booth includes:
> - **One** (1) **6-foot-long by 30-inch-wide table**
> - **Two** (2) chairs
> - **One** (1) **Powerstrip & electricity** at no additional cost
> - **10-foot-wide space, with a depth of 6 to 8 feet** (varies based on final layout)
> - **Curtained partitions** for booth separation
> - **Access to dedicated conference WiFi**
> - **Carpeting Not Required** (but is present at some booth locations)
> - **Diamond Sponsorship** includes a ***double-wide booth.***
>
>
> More details about the booth and booth selection are available in the **Sponsorship Information Packet** sent to participating sponsors.
>

#### How many attendees can I expect?
>
> Approximately 400 paid attendees, but around 650 individuals will be at the event (including sponsor staff and organizers) though attendance may vary. We consistently draw a strong audience of security professionals and decision-makers, providing valuable networking and engagement opportunities for sponsors.
> 

#### Is lead retrieval available for sponsors?
>
> Yes! We partner with a lead retrieval service to help sponsors connect with attendees more effectively. More details on how this service works and how you can take advantage of it will be provided as the event approaches.
>

#### What information is included in the opt-in attendee list?
>
> Release of the Opt-In Attendee list is an exclusive benefit for paid sponsors and is not available to prospective sponsors.
>
> The Opt-In List contains contact details for attendees who ***explicitly choose*** to share their information with sponsors when purchasing their tickets. The information provided includes:
> - Name
> - Email
> - Job Title
> - Company
> - Work Phone
>
>
> To encourage participation, we offer raffle drawings as an incentive for attendees to opt in. Only those who choose to share their information will be included in the list, in respect to privacy preferences.
>

#### How many sponsor passes are included?
>
> To ensure the best experience for both attendees and sponsors, as well as to accommodate our limited ticket availability, **we limit the number of sponsor passes** provided for team members working behind their booth.
> - Each sponsorship level includes a set number of sponsor passes for booth staff. Please see the pricing & benefits document.
> - Employees of sponsor companies are, of course, welcome to attend as regular attendees if they are not working the event.
> - If you need additional sponsor working passes, please contact us to discuss purchase options.
> - Sponsors may share passes among team members, but they must notify us in advance to coordinate.
> - For **Diamond and Platinum Sponsors**, the speaker(s) for your Sponsorship Slot must have a pass, whether using one that’s included in your allotted number or
purchased separately.
>
>
> Since this is a badged event, all sponsor representatives must be registered in advance. More details on how to register your sponsor reps will be provided for participating sponsors.
>

#### Where can I find more sponsorship details?
>
> Additional information is available in the **Sponsor Logistics Packet**, which is emailed to the designated contact for all participating sponsors. This packet includes important details on booth setup, event logistics, and other key information to help you prepare.
> 

#### When will I get my sponsor logistics packet?
>
> Your **Sponsor Logistics Packet** will be sent to your designated contact person shortly after your payment has been received. Please note that your sponsorship slot is not officially secured until payment is received. If you are a participating sponsor and have not received your packet or have any additional questions, please reach out to us at <sponsorship@rochestersecurity.org>
>

#### How do I make my payment?
>
> Once you have been selected as a sponsor, you will receive an email notification along with a separate **invoice from Stripe**. When a payment is successful, Stripe will issue you a receipt. 
>
> **Payment is due upon receipt of the invoice.** Please note that your sponsorship slot is **not officially secured until payment has been received.**
>
> Additionally, **booth choice** is influenced by a combination of your **Sponsorship Level** and the **date your payment is received**. Early payment can improve your chances of securing your preferred booth location and, for Platinum sponsors, your preferred time slot for the Sponsor Track presentation.
> 

#### Can I submit to the General CFP?
>
> Yes! You are welcome to submit to the General Call for Presentations (CFP). However, please keep in mind:
> - **Individual, Not Company-Based:** The General CFP sessions are awarded to individuals, not companies.
> - **Vendor-Neutral Content:** Presentations must be vendor-neutral, meaning you cannot promote or sell products, services, or commercial offerings.
> - **Juried Selection Process:** The General (vendor-neutral) CFP sessions are determined by the RSS Speaker Committee, who review all submissions and select which will be part of this year’s event.
> 
>
> We encourage you to share your expertise, insights, and industry knowledge in a way that is educational and unbiased.
>

#### Do I have to submit my Sponsor Talk or slides for review by the Committee?
>
> No. Sponsor Track presentations are an exclusive benefit for Platinum and Diamond sponsorsand not subject to review by the CFP committee or the sponsorship committee. The General CFP is managed by a completely separate committee with its own review process.
>
> As a **Diamond or Platinum Sponsor**, you have the flexibility to present content of your choosing during your Sponsor Talk.
>

#### Can employees from sponsor companies attend the conference as regular attendees?
>
> Yes! Employees from sponsor companies are welcome to attend the conference as regular attendees. They can purchase tickets through the standard registration process.
> 
> Please note: Regular attendees from sponsor companies will not be badged as booth staff and will be considered separate from your official sponsor representatives.
>

#### How do I register my team?
>
> You will receive detailed registration instructions by email, including how to register your booth staff and claim your included sponsor passes.
