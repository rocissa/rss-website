    - title: "Navigating the Cybersecurity Realm with Physical and Mental Illness"
      presenter: Elaine Harrison-Neukirch
      url: /2024/day2/track-1#track1-s1
      abstract: >
        In the Cyber Security industry, many individuals struggle with chronic physical or mental 
        illnesses while managing work and family life. These conditions often lead to increased pain, 
        fatigue, and anxiety, particularly in high-stress jobs. Many suffer in silence, fearing job loss 
        or being seen as inadequate if they disclose their illness. This environment can exacerbate 
        Imposter Syndrome, especially in toxic workplaces, leading to heightened stress and worsened 
        symptoms. Elaine, a cancer survivor, understands these challenges. This presentation explores why 
        symptoms flare and provides strategies to manage them, succeed in careers, and maintain energy for 
        family life.

    - title: "Dumpster Fires: 6 things about IR I learned by being a firefighter"
      presenter: Dr. Catherine J. Ullman
      url: /2024/day2/track-1#track3-s1
      abstract: >
        Threats surround us like a ring of burning fire. Unfortunately, incident response doesn't come 
        naturally to an operational mindset where the focus tends to be on reactive problem solving. As 
        a volunteer firefighter for over twenty years, the speaker has learned a lot about what is and 
        isn't effective. There are surprising parallels between fighting real-life fires and the 
        fire-fighting that passes for today’s incident response. It’s all too easy to get tunnel vision 
        and focus on the wrong areas, costing precious time. The security world is full of dumpster 
        fires these days, so join this session to learn from a good firefighter what makes a good 
        security person.

      abstract: >
        Have you ever tried to hack into an airport?


        No? We really wanted to, but too many three letter agencies expressed concerns - so we did the 
        next best thing: we built our own, let 500+ college students around the world try to hack into 
        it, and designed a security monitoring solution to track (and automate our responses to) 
        everything that happened.


        Join presenters Tom Kopchak and Meredith Kasper to learn about the security engineering used 
        to monitor and automate the 2023 Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition. If you enjoy

      presenter: Reg Harnish
      url: /2024/day2/track-1#track1-s5
      abstract: >
        On July 19th, the world faced an epic cyber disaster. Within minutes, 8.5 million computers 
        were compromised, marking the largest cybersecurity event in history. Airlines, banks, 
        hospitals, government agencies, and nearly 25,000 other businesses were incapacitated, causing 
        global chaos. Surprisingly, this wasn’t a coordinated ransomware or nation-state attack. It 
        wasn’t Revil, DarkSide, or Anonymous. The largest cybersecurity incident ever was caused by a 
        simple mistake from CrowdStrike. Despite the damages, the CrowdStrike incident may be the 
        wake-up call needed to shake up an industry long susceptible to the status quo and a lack of 
        imagination. Join us as we explore the best things to come from the CrowdStrike Meltdown - 
        lessons learned.

        In the aftermath of an attack victims are left wondering what they could have done better or 
        differently. When faced with nation-state attackers, the answer is often: not much. But, most 
        attacks aren't the product of a nation-state adversary. They are the work of professional 
        cybercriminals, intent on causing harm for financial gain. By analyzing hundreds of incident 
        response investigations, we can identify how the attackers are succeeding and what we can do 
        differently to change the narrative.

      presenter: Barry Hofecker

      abstract: >
        As businesses grapple with increasing digital complexity, continually evolving threats, increasing risk exposure, 
        and pressure from leadership to reduce costs, it is more important than ever for security teams provide assurance 
        that security investments support and promote business goals and objectives. In this presentation we will discuss 
        the principles of information security architecture, review two prominent security architecture frameworks and 
        learn how they can be leveraged to improve our security program and provide the assurance that the business is 
        looking for.

    - title: "Top Tips for Active Directory Defense"
      presenter: Eric Woodruff, Semperis
      url: /2024/day2/see-track-1#see1-s1
      abstract: >
        If your identity infrastructure is down, so is your business. That’s why attackers regularly target Microsoft 
        Active Directory (AD) and Entra ID. Gaining control of these identity systems can give threat actors near-total 
        control of all your systems, access to sensitive data, and the means to devastate your business. The ability to 
        defend and recover your hybrid AD environment is key to operational resilience.


        Join Eric Woodruff (Senior Security Researcher, Semperis) to learn:

        * Why AD and Entra ID security is vital for reliable business operations

        * How to improve identity security without breaking the bank

        * How to survive an attack on your identity infrastructure

        For over 30 years, CISA has recommended segmentation as a top priority. It makes sense – compromises will happen, 
        and reducing exposure is essential to protecting our data and preserving our reputation. Putting it into practice 
        – especially in complex multi-cloud environments – is difficult and fraught with challenges. Join ePlus and Cisco 
        to learn how Cisco Secure Workload can see what is truly happening in your environments, and quickly turn that 
        into a dynamic and responsive segmentation approach - today.  We’ll show how tomorrow’s approach (Cisco 
        Hypershield) promises to bring even more capability and offers a bright and investment-protected future.

        Even setting foot on a field of battle, whether for team sports or military purposes, requires extreme 
        self-confidence.  If you don't believe you can win, you very likely won't.  In the war against cyber crime, 
        however, it's important to balance that confidence with the understanding that this is also a team sport - and 
        hat none of us can win alone.  Join us for a discussion on navigating the line between confidence and 
        arrogance - and knowing when and how to seek and accept help from others.

            Eric has been working in computing and networking for almost 40 years, and had been focused on 
            cybersecurity since the mid 90's.  While primarily a left-brained, logic-minded, full-on nerd and engineer 
            that has served in just about every technical capacity from coding, to technical support, to pre and 
            post-sales work, he currently spends the majority of his time working with clients to solve their varied 
            security challenges. Once referred to as an "eloquent nerd", Eric leverages his passion, collective 
            experience, creative thinking, and a empathetic understanding of customer issues and motivations to 
            architect solutions to difficult problems while fostering deeper comprehension with those he works with 
            and teaches.  Almost above all, Eric enjoys what he does and tries to instill some "fun" in all of his 
            outreach.
