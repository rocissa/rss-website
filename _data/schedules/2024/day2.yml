    - title: "Work From Home and Security Risks: SASE Solution"
      presenter: Trueye Tafese
      url: /2024/day2/track-1#track1-s1
      abstract: >
        The shift to remote work has introduced new security challenges that organizations must address 
        to protect their data and systems. By understanding the security risks associated with WFH and 
        implementing the appropriate mitigation strategies, businesses can create a secure remote 
        working environment.


        This talk dives into the safety concerns tied to remote work, from network weak spots to data 
        privacy issues, and looks at why outdated security systems fall short in tackling these 
        problems. It presents the Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) concept as an all-encompassing 
        answer that brings together networking and security into one cloud-based service.

      presenter: Dr. Catherine J. Ullman
      url: /2024/day2/track-1#track3-s1
      abstract: >
        Threats surround us like a ring of burning fire. Unfortunately, incident response doesn't come 
        naturally to an operational mindset where the focus tends to be on reactive problem solving. As 
        a volunteer firefighter for over twenty years, the speaker has learned a lot about what is and 
        isn't effective. There are surprising parallels between fighting real-life fires and the 
        fire-fighting that passes for today’s incident response. It’s all too easy to get tunnel vision 
        and focus on the wrong areas, costing precious time. The security world is full of dumpster 
        fires these days, so join this session to learn from a good firefighter what makes a good 
        security person.

      abstract: >
        Have you ever tried to hack into an airport?


        No? We really wanted to, but too many three letter agencies expressed concerns - so we did the 
        next best thing: we built our own, let 500+ college students around the world try to hack into 
        it, and designed a security monitoring solution to track (and automate our responses to) 
        everything that happened.


        Join presenters Tom Kopchak and Meredith Kasper to learn about the security engineering used 
        to monitor and automate the 2023 Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition. If you enjoy

      presenter: Reg Harnish
      url: /2024/day2/track-1#track1-s5
      abstract: >
        On July 19th, the world faced an epic cyber disaster. Within minutes, 8.5 million computers 
        were compromised, marking the largest cybersecurity event in history. Airlines, banks, 
        hospitals, government agencies, and nearly 25,000 other businesses were incapacitated, causing 
        global chaos. Surprisingly, this wasn’t a coordinated ransomware or nation-state attack. It 
        wasn’t Revil, DarkSide, or Anonymous. The largest cybersecurity incident ever was caused by a 
        simple mistake from CrowdStrike. Despite the damages, the CrowdStrike incident may be the 
        wake-up call needed to shake up an industry long susceptible to the status quo and a lack of 
        imagination. Join us as we explore the best things to come from the CrowdStrike Meltdown - 
        lessons learned.

        In the aftermath of an attack victims are left wondering what they could have done better or 
        differently. When faced with nation-state attackers, the answer is often: not much. But, most 
        attacks aren't the product of a nation-state adversary. They are the work of professional 
        cybercriminals, intent on causing harm for financial gain. By analyzing hundreds of incident

    - title: "Top Tips for Active Directory Defense"
      presenter: Eric Woodruff, Semperis
      url: /2024/day2/see-track-1#sponsor1-s1
      abstract: >
        If your identity infrastructure is down, so is your business. That’s why attackers regularly target Microsoft 
        Active Directory (AD) and Entra ID. Gaining control of these identity systems can give threat actors near-total 
        control of all your systems, access to sensitive data, and the means to devastate your business. The ability to 
        defend and recover your hybrid AD environment is key to operational resilience.


        Join Eric Woodruff (Senior Security Researcher, Semperis) to learn:

        * Why AD and Entra ID security is vital for reliable business operations

        * How to improve identity security without breaking the bank

        * How to survive an attack on your identity infrastructure

        For over 30 years, CISA has recommended segmentation as a top priority. It makes sense – compromises will happen, 
        and reducing exposure is essential to protecting our data and preserving our reputation. Putting it into practice 
        – especially in complex multi-cloud environments – is difficult and fraught with challenges. Join ePlus and Cisco 
        to learn how Cisco Secure Workload can see what is truly happening in your environments, and quickly turn that 
        into a dynamic and responsive segmentation approach - today.  We’ll show how tomorrow’s approach (Cisco 
        Hypershield) promises to bring even more capability and offers a bright and investment-protected future.

      presenter: Henry Reed, Palo Alto Networks
      url: /2024/day2/see-track-2#sponsor2-s1
      abstract: >
        Join our discussion to explore how modern cloud security demands are being met through the 
        combined power of Precision AI and cloud platformization. You will learn how Palo Alto Networks' 
        ortex XSIAM leverages AI-driven insights to deliver more accurate, real-time threat detection 
        and automated response, significantly reducing false positives and enhancing operational 
        efficiency. We’ll also cover how Prisma Cloud extends this protection across the entire 
        cloud-native stack, providing comprehensive security for workloads, containers, and applications. 
        Integrating these capabilities into a unified platform allows security teams to streamline 
        workflows, improve visibility, and dramatically accelerate Mean Time to Identify (MTTI) and Mean 
        Time to Respond (MTTR) for threats across cloud environments. Through real-world examples and 
        live demonstrations, we will showcase how these technologies enable organizations to respond 
        faster, secure their cloud-native infrastructure with greater precision, and reduce complexity—all 
        while adapting to the rapidly evolving cloud security landscape.

      abstract: >
        Even setting foot on a field of battle, whether for team sports or military purposes, requires extreme 
        self-confidence.  If you don't believe you can win, you very likely won't.  In the war against cyber crime, 
        however, it's important to balance that confidence with the understanding that this is also a team sport - and 
        hat none of us can win alone.  Join us for a discussion on navigating the line between confidence and 
        arrogance - and knowing when and how to seek and accept help from others.
