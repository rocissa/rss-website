    - title: "Tabletop Exercises: Enhancing Incident Preparedness and Response"
      presenter: Javier Figueroa
      url: /2024/day1/track-1#track1-s1
      abstract: >
        Tabletop exercises have emerged as a cornerstone in incident and disaster preparedness. In this 
        presentation, we discuss the purpose, benefits, structure and future of tabletop exercises.


        Tabletop exercises are valuable because they create realistic scenarios within a controlled setting, 
        allowing organizations to assess how well they’re prepared to handle different crises. By bringing 
        together key stakeholders, decision-makers, and subject matter experts, tabletop exercises promote 
        collaboration, communication, and critical thinking. In this presentation, we will explore the essential 
        elements of tabletop exercises, including scenario development, execution, and evaluation.

      url: /2024/day1/track-1#track1-s2
      abstract: >
        This is NOT an AI talk! Automation is applying technology to "achieve outcomes with minimal 
        human interaction". This talk is about the emerging cybersecurity standards and how they enable 
        automation. It will cover why this is important (save money, respond at machine speed, maximize 
        scare human expertise), what is involved (including explaining the alphabet soup of acronyms), 
        and present results from the use cases demo'd at the Cybersecurity Automation Village 
        (including OlympicDestroyer and SBOMs). The talk will also have a related sidebar into how we 
        must be doing something right if the Russians and Iranians are objecting to our work at UN 
        agencies like the ITU.

    - title: "Harnessing AI for Advanced Network Security: From Attacks on Privacy to Defensive Innovations"
      presenter: Nate Mathews and Matthew Wright
      url: /2024/day1/track-1#track1-s3
      abstract: >
        In this talk, we delve into the application of state-of-the-art AI methods to bolster both 
        offensive and defensive mechanisms in network security. We start by examining the landscape of 
        advanced network threats, including AI-driven attacks on privacy-enhancing technologies like 
        VPNs and Tor, and the sophisticated nature of pivoting attacks in network intrusions. 
        Specifically, we will discuss a class of privacy attacks known as Flow Correlation attacks. We 
        will then show how these offensive techniques can be adapted and repurposed for defense, to 
        detect pivoting in network intrusion attacks. Our methodologies, results, and implications 
        highlight the strengths and limitations of AI, contributing to a more robust understanding of 
        attacks.

      abstract: >
        Dive into the world of cyber generative AI and explore its dual nature as both a potential 
        cybersecurity risk and a valuable tool for security teams. We explore how adversaries carry out 
        attacks, including various ways in which generative AI can be exploited for malicious purposes, 
        including deepfake creation and automated phishing attacks. Conversely, we also examine the 
        innovative applications of generative AI in enhancing cybersecurity measures, such as alert and 
        risk event explanation, custom and prescriptive guidance, advanced threat hunting. This session 
        provides a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by 
        generative AI in the cybersecurity landscape.

      abstract: >
        Vulnerability management is a critical aspect of safeguarding an organization’s infrastructure.
        This talk will introduce a comprehensive approach to vulnerability management that not only 
        identifies vulnerabilities but also enriches, risk-ranks, and prioritizes them for effective use 
        of available remediation resources. We will explore a system and process designed to ingest scan 
        data, enhance it with valuable insights from sources like Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)
        and Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), and deliver actionable intelligence to IT teams. 
        Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how to implement a prioritized, data-driven 
        vulnerability management strategy in their organizations.

      presenter: Bruce Cheney
      url: /2024/day1/track-2#track2-s2
      abstract: >
        Cyber risk is a growing concern for businesses of all sizes. According to the FBI, there were 
        over $12.5 Billion in losses due to cybercrime in 2023. And as cyber criminals are getting more 
        sophisticated, they are increasingly using extortion and the Dark Web to their advantage. The 
        combination of ransomware, extortion, and the dark web pose a serious threat to businesses.

        
        In this presentation, Bruce Cheney, Sr. Engineer at Arctic Wolf, will lead a discussion on what
        Real Risk looks like and what you can do to increase your security posture. He will talk about 
        the growing threat of cybercrime groups, show you Dark Web Data Leaks, and provide the steps you 
        can take to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to being a victim of cybercrime.

      presenter: Chas Clawson
      url: /2024/day1/track-2#track2-s3
      abstract: >
        In today’s rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, avoiding concentrated risk in a 
        consolidated security solutions market is crucial. As companies increasingly rely on fewer 
        providers, the potential impact of a single point of failure grows. This can lead to 
        vulnerabilities and increased exposure to cyber threats. Diversifying security solutions 
        helps mitigate this risk by ensuring that no single vendor’s weaknesses can compromise the 
        entire system. It also fosters innovation and flexibility, allowing organizations to adapt to 
        new threats and technologies. By embracing a multi-vendor strategy, businesses can enhance 
        their resilience and maintain robust security in a dynamic digital environment.

      abstract: >
        Infosec teams are overtaxed and underfunded, and often now tasked with assessing and managing 
        AI risk,  AI governance approaches vary, however, and the technology is in flux.  Fortunately, 
        significant overlap and synergy exists between good security practice and ethical AI governance 
        functions, such that Infosec teams are especially well suited to assess and potentially manage 
        AI risk. This discussion will focus on the interplay between Infosec and AI governance frameworks, 
        and offer practical solutions on how to govern once, comply many in relation to AI and Infosec.  
        It will also offer strategies an Infosec team can use to leverage interest in AI to create focus 
        and budget for core infosec functions.

      abstract: >
        With recent progress in the development of large-scale, general-purpose, fault-tolerant Quantum 
        Computing (QC), significant effort is being made in the cryptography community to create viable 
        long-term solutions against the threat of QC breaking classical public-key security schemes. The 
        current Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process led by the NIST has made some 
        selections and is about to recommend new cryptographic protocols resistant to QC. This talk reports 
        our experiences from teaching a first-in-kind module-based course in Quantum-Resistant Cryptography 
        (QRC) at two universities. The subject of QRC will take on additional importance as the U.S. and 
        other countries start to transition to QRC-based solutions.
