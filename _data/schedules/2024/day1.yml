      presenter: Javier Figueroa
      url: /2024/day1/track-1#track1-s1
      abstract: >
        Tabletop exercises have emerged as a cornerstone in incident and disaster preparedness. In this 
        presentation, we discuss the purpose, benefits, structure and future of tabletop exercises.


        Tabletop exercises are valuable because they create realistic scenarios within a controlled setting, 
        allowing organizations to assess how well they’re prepared to handle different crises. By bringing 
        together key stakeholders, decision-makers, and subject matter experts, tabletop exercises promote 
        collaboration, communication, and critical thinking. In this presentation, we will explore the essential 
        elements of tabletop exercises, including scenario development, execution, and evaluation.

      presenter: Nate Mathews and Matthew Wright
      url: /2024/day1/track-1#track1-s3
      abstract: >
        In this talk, we delve into the application of state-of-the-art AI methods to bolster both 
        offensive and defensive mechanisms in network security. We start by examining the landscape of 
        advanced network threats, including AI-driven attacks on privacy-enhancing technologies like 
        VPNs and Tor, and the sophisticated nature of pivoting attacks in network intrusions. 
        Specifically, we will discuss a class of privacy attacks known as Flow Correlation attacks. We 
        will then show how these offensive techniques can be adapted and repurposed for defense, to 
        detect pivoting in network intrusion attacks. Our methodologies, results, and implications 
        highlight the strengths and limitations of AI, contributing to a more robust understanding of 
        attacks.

      presenter: Chas Clawson
      url: /2024/day1/track-2#track2-s3
      abstract: >
        In today’s rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, avoiding concentrated risk in a 
        consolidated security solutions market is crucial. As companies increasingly rely on fewer 
        providers, the potential impact of a single point of failure grows. This can lead to 
        vulnerabilities and increased exposure to cyber threats. Diversifying security solutions 
        helps mitigate this risk by ensuring that no single vendor’s weaknesses can compromise the 
        entire system. It also fosters innovation and flexibility, allowing organizations to adapt to 
        new threats and technologies. By embracing a multi-vendor strategy, businesses can enhance 
        their resilience and maintain robust security in a dynamic digital environment.

      presenter: Jason Trunk, Island
      url: /2024/day1/see-track-1#see1-s2
      abstract: >
        IT professionals and cybersecurity practitioners face immense challenges adapting to shifts in the 
        desired work models employed by users and their organizations. According to recent Gartner®&rreg; 
        research*, "Enterprise browsers will evolve to become the core platform for almost all of the 
        day-to-day enterprise productivity and security software used by the workforce." Traditional architectural 
        approaches are quite limited in such areas as BYOD programs, contractor/third-party provisioning, 
        hybrid work, and modernization efforts. What if solutions to many of these difficult challenges could be 
        solved by reimagining the browser as a core component of enterprise architecture?


        In this session, Island will provide examples on how this new category and technology:


        * Revolutionizes your organization, enabling you to address modern work challenges while unlocking new opportunities.
        
        * Streamlines BYOD, contractor/third-party, and hybrid work initiatives with innovative architectural approaches
        
        * Implements novel security measures to safeguard organizational applications and data

      url: /2024/day1/see-track-1#see1-s3
      abstract: >
        Traditional security information and event management (SIEM) solutions can’t detect cyberattacks that span 
        multiple security layers, making them difficult to resolve.


        Extended Detection and Response (XDR) is the natural evolution from EDR to expand coverage and protect against 
        sophisticated attackers. This session covers how XDR provides security teams greater visibility so informed 
        decisions on where to invest time and resources can be made.


        Learn how XDR’s use of APIs, AI, and ML for automatic threat investigation and correlation differs from 
        traditional SIEM systems. See a demo showcasing how ProArch’s SOC leverages Microsoft Defender XDR for automatic 
        resolution and cross-product threat hunting. Attendees will receive three Microsoft Defender threat hunting queries!
