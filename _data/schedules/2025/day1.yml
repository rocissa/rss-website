    - title: Why Your Employees Should Click MORE Suspicious Emails (Seriously)
      presenter: Joshua Crumbaugh
      abstract: >
        People tune out slide decks; they lean into stories, streaks, and social proof. Social Engineering 
        for Good distills decades of behavior science into a 10-control framework that trains instinct, not 
        compliance. Learn why identical-element practice, dual-coding visuals, and variable-reward gamification 
        slash phishing success up to 95%, and see a maturity ladder that lets any CISO measure culture immunity 
        in 90 days.

      abstract: >
        Government agencies typically run tabletop exercises with critical infrastructure stakeholders for 
        disaster scenarios, which benefit from modern gaming technology and design to provide greater appeal 
        and engagement. With the Army Cyber Institute (West Point), an RIT team developed an open-source 
        framework, JACK VOLTAIC‚Ñ¢ 4 (JV4), to educate government and industry stakeholders about cybersecurity 
        attacks on critical infrastructure sectors, especially given convergences with physical disasters. JV4 
        includes a framework to modify provided games or create new ones via digital card game mechanics. The 
        presentation will demonstrate JV4‚Äôs framework, card-based gameplay, built-in networking, and cards for 
        attackers, defenders, and physical events.

      presenter: Stephanie Schneider
      abstract: >
        In today‚Äôs threat landscape, credential-based attacks and geopolitically driven cyber campaigns 
        are persistent and evolving. This session shows how organizations can shift from reactive defense 
        to proactive security by operationalizing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and AI-driven automation 
        to anticipate identity-based threats. Stephanie Schneider will share real-world cases where CTI 
        enabled early detection of credential leaks and geopolitical warning signals, helping organizations 
        strengthen Identity and Access Management (IAM) and adjust security posture. Attendees will learn 
        to embed CTI into IAM, automate response, and align intelligence with business risk.

      presenter: Brandon Finton
      abstract: >
        Penetration testing is often treated as a technical checkbox or annual compliance task, 
        with findings reviewed briefly and then forgotten. This session challenges that approach 
        by showing how pen test results should be integrated into an organization‚Äôs GRC program. 
        Through real-world examples, we‚Äôll show how technical issues often reflect deeper 
        governance failures like weak policies or poor change control. Attendees will learn how 
        to map findings to risk, track them through governance, and communicate them in business 
        terms. We‚Äôll also define stakeholder roles to ensure issues aren‚Äôt just patched‚Äîbut 
        prioritized and managed at the right level.

    - title: Reduce the Blast Radius with Microsegmentation
      presenter: Jonathan Borgesen
      abstract: >
        Many organizations struggle with security in complex IT environments, from legacy data 
        centers to the cloud deployments. A key challenge is defending against malicious lateral 
        movement (east/west traffic). We will discuss how segmentation and microsegmentation offer a 
        proven strategy to mitigate these risks. We'll explore how these approaches enhance security 
        across all IT infrastructure layers by creating granular, isolated security zones around workloads 
        and applications. You'll gain insights into how this significantly reduces the "blast radius" of a 
        breach, limits attacker movement, and strengthens your overall cybersecurity posture.

      presenter: Or Eshed
      abstract: >
        Malicious browser extensions are an emerging attack vector for a simple reason: they work. 
        In fact, compromised browser extensions are probably the biggest under-the-radar threat surface 
        that most organizations don‚Äôt know about. Malicious browser extensions can steal a wide array 
        of user identity information such as passwords, cookies, session tokens, etc., as well as 
        sensitive data, such as page contents, input method interception, audio/video access, and more. 
        In this session, we will explore malicious extensions, how they become compromised, what data 
        they can access, and how they work under the hood, out of the belief that this is an up-and-coming 
        threat vector that is relevant to a broad cross-section of security practitioners today.

      presenter: Roopak Patel
      abstract: >
        As artificial intelligence reshapes both cybersecurity defenses and attack strategies, identity 
        security has become the last stronghold against breaches. With stolen credentials playing a 
        role in nearly one-third of cyberattacks, organizations must rethink how they secure human and 
        machine identities. This presentation explores the evolving threat landscape, where AI is not 
        only a tool for defenders but also an asset for adversaries. We'll examine how AI-driven cyber 
        threats are increasing in sophistication and how organizations can leverage AI-powered identity 
        security solutions‚Äîincluding Privileged Access Management (PAM), Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement 
        Management (CIEM), and Identity Threat Detection & Response (ITDR)‚Äîto mitigate risk. Key topics 
        include AI's role in risk scoring, dynamic policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection in 
        privileged access.

    - title: "Neutralizing the Risks of Compromised Credentials"
      presenter: Kevin Reardon
      abstract: >
        Stolen credentials are one of the most common ways attackers break into organizations‚Äîand 
        often through partners or vendors. This session explores the real risks behind compromised 
        usernames and passwords, how attackers steal them, and why identity is often the weakest 
        link. We‚Äôll look at common attack methods like phishing, MFA fatigue, and supply chain 
        breaches where one compromised partner account can open the door to many. We will share how 
        the Enterprise Browser can help protect against compromised credential exploitation.

    - title: "Preventing the Domino Effect: Identity, Cloud, and Your Cyber Resilience Strategy"
      presenter: Matt Castiotta and Paul Lenhard
      abstract: >
        Identity-based attacks are a CISO's nightmare, with 90% of cyber intrusions leveraging phished 
        or leaked credentials and privilege escalation. Once compromised, attackers can move anywhere 
        across the data estate and are frequently infiltrating your cloud environments. In this session, 
        we'll dive into the unified approach of Rubrik Identity and Cloud Resilience, demonstrating how 
        it goes beyond traditional data protection to secure your entire hybrid identity, including 
        Active Directory and Entra ID, as well as safeguarding your ability to recover data after an 
        incident. We'll explore how to proactively manage identity and data risk, continuously monitor 
        for changes, and‚Äîwhen prevention fails‚Äîorchestrate a fast, clean recovery of all your data 
        across your identity & cloud platforms. You will learn how your organization can maintain 
        business continuity, even in the face of a catastrophic event.
