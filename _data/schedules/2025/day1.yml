    - title: Why Your Employees Should Click MORE Suspicious Emails (Seriously)
      presenter: Joshua Crumbaugh
      abstract: >
        People tune out slide decks; they lean into stories, streaks, and social proof. Social Engineering 
        for Good distills decades of behavior science into a 10-control framework that trains instinct, not 
        compliance. Learn why identical-element practice, dual-coding visuals, and variable-reward gamification 
        slash phishing success up to 95%, and see a maturity ladder that lets any CISO measure culture immunity 
        in 90 days.

    - title: Critical Infrastructure Security in Your Home Town
      presenter: David I. Schwartz, Ph.D.
      abstract: >
        Government agencies typically run tabletop exercises with critical infrastructure stakeholders for 
        disaster scenarios, which benefit from modern gaming technology and design to provide greater appeal 
        and engagement. With the Army Cyber Institute (West Point), an RIT team developed an open-source 
        framework, JACK VOLTAIC™ 4 (JV4), to educate government and industry stakeholders about cybersecurity 
        attacks on critical infrastructure sectors, especially given convergences with physical disasters. JV4 
        includes a framework to modify provided games or create new ones via digital card game mechanics. The 
        presentation will demonstrate JV4’s framework, card-based gameplay, built-in networking, and cards for 
        attackers, defenders, and physical events.

    - title: A Beginner's Guide MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for AI Systems)
      presenter: Elaine Harrison-Neukirch
      abstract: >
        Artificial intelligence is powering everything from job screening tools to self-driving cars—but what 
        happens when hackers go after the AI itself? In this fun and accessible talk, we’ll explore MITRE 
        ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems), a growing framework designed 
        to help us understand and defend against attacks targeting machine learning and AI systems.

        This session will guide you through:

        - What MITRE ATLAS is and how it works
        - Real-world examples of how you can use MITRE ATLAS to defend your organization.
        - Simple ways to start thinking about AI security and governance.
        - You’ll leave with a clear understanding of AI-specific threats, how they differ from traditional cyberattacks. 
        - Bring your laptop if you’d like to explore MITRE ATLAS during the session.

    - title: "What Could Go Wrong?: AI Security Mistakes Even Fortune 500 Companies Are Making"
      presenter: Savannah Alfaro & Zachary Wallace
      abstract: >
        As AI systems rapidly integrate into applications and workflows, they introduce a new set of risks 
        and reshape existing security challenges. This talk dives into the key threats outlined in the OWASP 
        Top 10 for LLMs, including prompt injection, sensitive data disclosure, and excessive agency. We'll 
        demonstrate these vulnerabilities using real-world scenarios with mock demonstrations and discuss how 
        to test, harden, and responsibly deploy AI solutions. Whether you're involved in red teaming, 
        development, or defense, you'll leave with practical takeaways and a deeper understanding of LLM-specific 
        threats.

    - title: "Leading in Times of Uncertainty; 9/11/01: The White House"
      presenter: Robert J. Darling
      abstract: >
        On 9/11, I supported the White House response from the underground White House bunker known 
        as the PEOC, witnessing firsthand the demands of crisis leadership. "Leading in Times of 
        Uncertainty" explores how leaders like Vice President Cheney and National Security Advisor 
        Rice made urgent decisions with limited information. The experience underscores traits essential 
        in any crisis: clear communication, adaptability, and moral courage. Drawing parallels to IT 
        professionals, the presentation provides a framework for responding under pressure, emphasizing 
        preparedness, real-time strategy shifts, and decision-making amid uncertainty.

    - title: Cyber Threat Intelligence Content Analyst
      presenter: Stephanie Keinz
      abstract: >
        In today’s threat landscape, credential-based attacks and geopolitically driven cyber campaigns 
        are persistent and evolving. This session shows how organizations can shift from reactive defense 
        to proactive security by operationalizing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and AI-driven automation 
        to anticipate identity-based threats. Stephanie Schneider will share real-world cases where CTI 
        enabled early detection of credential leaks and geopolitical warning signals, helping organizations 
        strengthen Identity and Access Management (IAM) and adjust security posture. Attendees will learn 
        to embed CTI into IAM, automate response, and align intelligence with business risk.

    - title: "Beyond the Report: Why Pen Testing is a GRC Responsibility"
      presenter: Brandon Finton
      abstract: >
        Penetration testing is often treated as a technical checkbox or annual compliance task, 
        with findings reviewed briefly and then forgotten. This session challenges that approach 
        by showing how pen test results should be integrated into an organization’s GRC program. 
        Through real-world examples, we’ll show how technical issues often reflect deeper 
        governance failures like weak policies or poor change control. Attendees will learn how 
        to map findings to risk, track them through governance, and communicate them in business 
        terms. We’ll also define stakeholder roles to ensure issues aren’t just patched—but 
        prioritized and managed at the right level.

      presenter: Mark Christman
      abstract: >
        Governance, for all the hype, is straight forward and simple. That doesn't mean 'easy'. 
        We'll peel away all the extras and get to basics about what Governance is, and how to 
        approach governance regardless of context. This talk will help build the solid foundation 
        to build a solid governance framework on.

    - title: Reduce the Blast Radius with Microsegmentation
      presenter: Jonathan Borgesen
      abstract: >
        Many organizations struggle with security in complex IT environments, from legacy data 
        centers to the cloud deployments. A key challenge is defending against malicious lateral 
        movement (east/west traffic). We will discuss how segmentation and microsegmentation offer a 
        proven strategy to mitigate these risks. We'll explore how these approaches enhance security 
        across all IT infrastructure layers by creating granular, isolated security zones around workloads 
        and applications. You'll gain insights into how this significantly reduces the "blast radius" of a 
        breach, limits attacker movement, and strengthens your overall cybersecurity posture.

    - title: Beginner’s Guide to Starting a Security Home Lab
      presenter: Jim Keeler
      abstract: >
        Want to level up your security skills without risking your production environment—or 
        your job? In this talk, we’ll walk through building your own security home lab: a low-cost, 
        high-impact space to test tools, simulate attacks, and sharpen both offensive and defensive 
        skills. Whether you're into red teaming, detection engineering, or just breaking things for 
        fun, you'll learn how to architect, deploy, and maintain a lab tailored to your goals. We'll 
        cover practical setups and tips to get started fast. No enterprise budget required—just curiosity, 
        that crappy old laptop in your closet, and a power strip.

    - title:  Stealing User Credentials and Data with Malicious Browser Extensions
      presenter: Or Eshed
      abstract: >
        Malicious browser extensions are an emerging attack vector for a simple reason: they work. 
        In fact, compromised browser extensions are probably the biggest under-the-radar threat surface 
        that most organizations don’t know about. Malicious browser extensions can steal a wide array 
        of user identity information such as passwords, cookies, session tokens, etc., as well as 
        sensitive data, such as page contents, input method interception, audio/video access, and more. 
        In this session, we will explore malicious extensions, how they become compromised, what data 
        they can access, and how they work under the hood, out of the belief that this is an up-and-coming 
        threat vector that is relevant to a broad cross-section of security practitioners today.
