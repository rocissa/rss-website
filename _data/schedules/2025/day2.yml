    - title: "When AI Walks Through the Front Door: Using Artificial Intelligence for Physical Social Engineering"
      presenter: Steve Stasiukonis
      abstract: >
        AI made breaking into a secure data center a lot less like "Mission: Impossible" and more like "Mission: 
        Improbably Easy." We used an AI tool to gather public information (OSINT) from all over the internet. 
        When sensitive information is entered into AI systems—especially public or third-party platforms—it 
        stops being just your private data and quietly becomes shared or "cooperatively private" data.  My 
        session will step you through the scenario of how this intelligence was used to compromise a highly 
        secure facility. The session is informative while also carries a lot of humor.

    - title: "Keeping your AI in Check; No, It Shouldn't Know Your Passwords"
      presenter: David Santeramo
      abstract: >
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries and societies worldwide, offering 
        unprecedented opportunities and benefits.  However, the deployment of AI systems also introduces 
        significant security risks and challenges.  This presentation will delve into the critical aspects of 
        AI security, with a particular emphasis on risk management and governance frameworks.  We will explore 
        the types of risks associated with AI, including breaches, adversarial attacks, and compliance challenges.  
        The discussion will cover the potential vulnerabilities in AI systems and the impact these risks can have 
        on organizational operations and trust.

    - title: "Exposing the Real Risk: How Ransomware, Extortion, and the Dark Web Are Evolving"
      presenter: Bruce Cheney
      abstract: >
        Cybercriminals aren’t just using ransomware—they’re running extortion campaigns, leaking data on the 
        dark web, and adapting faster than ever. With losses exceeding $16.6 billion in 2024, the stakes are 
        higher than ever for security teams. In this technical session, Bruce Cheney, Sr. Engineer at Arctic 
        Wolf, dives deep into how today’s most dangerous threat actors operate. He’ll analyze real-world data 
        leaks, dissect extortion tactics, and walk through the dark web ecosystems where stolen data is 
        traded. Expect real-world insights, examples of leaked data, and a no-jargon framework to guide 
        strategic cybersecurity decisions. This talk is designed to sharpen your understanding of Risk and 
        strengthen your response.

    - title: "Hacking the Process - Business Process Compromise"
      presenter: Sherwyn Moodley & James Hasewinkle
      abstract: >
        The information security field focuses on preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, 
        modification, inspection, recording, or destruction of information. This is accomplished by securing 
        assets and people, using frameworks and methodologies such as the CIS top 18 and NIST. Hacking a 
        Business Process requires hacking these assets or people first, but the business process still needs 
        to be secured. Financial Processes such as Purchase Order process, HR processes such as employee 
        termination pose a great risk to any organization because if the process is manipulated sufficiently 
        any theft rising from it becomes much harder to identify.

    - title: "Breach Response in Real Time: An Interactive Cybersecurity Simulation"
      presenter: John D. Flory III
      abstract: >
        Join us for Breach Response in Real Time, an interactive incident response simulation that puts 
        you in the middle of a live cyberattack scenario. Through video storytelling and expert-led 
        discussion, you'll make key decisions as a breach unfolds. Explore third-party risk, public 
        notification, damage control, malware containment, and more. This hands-on tabletop exercise 
        challenges assumptions, sparks new strategies, and prepares your team for real-world threats. 
        Ideal for IT leaders, executives, and security professionals.

    - title: "Beyond the Obvious: Why 1+1 = 3 in Third-Party Risk"
      presenter: Alicia Gristmacher
      abstract: >
        Traditional third-party risk management often relies on basic compliance checks, missing 
        critical risks. This session introduces subjective and deductive reasoning methods within 
        the MITRE ATT&CK framework to deeply assess vendor security. Real-world examples illustrate 
        how these techniques effectively uncover hidden vulnerabilities and strengthen proactive 
        risk management.

    - title: "Disaster Recovery Planning: From Theory to Action"
      presenter: Jason Taylor
      abstract: >
        This presentation covers how to create a practical disaster recovery plan to quickly restore 
        operations after a widespread or severe service disruption. Organizations often struggle to 
        create usable disaster recovery plans due to limited visibility into their infrastructure or 
        the assumption that disaster recovery preparedness is cost prohibitive. We’ll break down these 
        barriers by sharing an approachable, methodical strategy for creating a disaster recovery plan. 
        You’ll learn about the disaster handling lifecycle, backup strategies, recovery priorities, and 
        more. We’ll also examine a disaster recovery plan template adaptable for your organization.

    - title: "Lessons Learned from the OWASP Amass Project"
      presenter: Jeff Foley
      abstract: >
        The OWASP Amass Project has long served as a powerful tool for mapping external attack surfaces. 
        Recent enhancements have elevated its discovery capabilities by incorporating insights into the 
        organizations that register internet namespaces and IP address ranges. This talk will explore 
        how leveraging Legal Entity Identifiers and RIR RDAP data enables more accurate and expansive 
        identification of assets—not only for a target organization but also for its partners, suppliers, 
        and third-party services. These improvements help organizations perform deeper risk assessments 
        and enhance their overall security posture. Attendees will learn how to use these new features 
        to uncover hidden exposure and dependencies across complex digital ecosystems.

    - title: "My Cyber Sense Is Tingling! Detection Engineering With Free Tools"
      presenter: Matthew Gracie
      abstract: >
        Every threat hunt, every incident response, and every bulletin from your ISAC comes with a wealth 
        of intelligence that you can leverage to spot suspicious or malicious activity in the future. The 
        process of taking that information and turning it into reliable, repeatable alerting is known as 
        Detection Engineering. In this talk I will demo the free and open Security Onion platform, the 
        methods by which it can generate or ingest logs about your environment, and how we can use that 
        log data to trigger alerts for potential incidents. Whether you're looking for artifacts in network 
        traffic, file structures, or endpoint logs, it's easy to create new detection rules so your analysts 
        are aware when something suspicious rears its head.

    - title: "Drag, Drop, Defend: Making Security Scripts Accessible to Everyone"
      presenter: Gregory Stachura
      abstract: >
        Not all security analysts are strong coders or scripters, but they know what they need and 
        when they need it. This talk will go through examples of how you can take a script written 
        by one of your stronger coders and enable the rest of your team to build their own 
        automations, workflows or integrations with low or no code solutions. Learn the options at 
        your disposal for empowering your analysts to streamline their jobs to get quicker 
        resolutions and free them up to focus on proactive security rather then reactive 
        security measures.

    - title: "Insecuring your Data Using Federated Authentication"
      presenter: Clay Cooper
      abstract: >
        Federated authentication is the gateway to zero-trust networking and access to the 
        explosion of SaaS products that contain your company's data. How do you know that 
        those products are correctly handling your single sign-on responses? We'll talk about 
        the common SSO protocols, how they work, how to test that they're configured securely, and 
        see some hypothetical ways that they've gone wrong in the past.
