    - title: "When AI Walks Through the Front Door: Using Artificial Intelligence for Physical Social Engineering"
      presenter: Steve Stasiukonis
      abstract: >
        AI made breaking into a secure data center a lot less like "Mission: Impossible" and more like "Mission: 
        Improbably Easy." We used an AI tool to gather public information (OSINT) from all over the internet. 
        When sensitive information is entered into AI systems—especially public or third-party platforms—it 
        stops being just your private data and quietly becomes shared or "cooperatively private" data.  My 
        session will step you through the scenario of how this intelligence was used to compromise a highly 
        secure facility. The session is informative while also carries a lot of humor.

    - title: "Hacking the Process - Business Process Compromise"
      presenter: Sherwyn Moodley & James Hasewinkle
      abstract: >
        The information security field focuses on preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, 
        modification, inspection, recording, or destruction of information. This is accomplished by securing 
        assets and people, using frameworks and methodologies such as the CIS top 18 and NIST. Hacking a 
        Business Process requires hacking these assets or people first, but the business process still needs 
        to be secured. Financial Processes such as Purchase Order process, HR processes such as employee 
        termination pose a great risk to any organization because if the process is manipulated sufficiently 
        any theft rising from it becomes much harder to identify.

      presenter: Jason Taylor
      abstract: >
        This presentation covers how to create a practical disaster recovery plan to quickly restore 
        operations after a widespread or severe service disruption. Organizations often struggle to 
        create usable disaster recovery plans due to limited visibility into their infrastructure or 
        the assumption that disaster recovery preparedness is cost prohibitive. We’ll break down these 
        barriers by sharing an approachable, methodical strategy for creating a disaster recovery plan. 
        You’ll learn about the disaster handling lifecycle, backup strategies, recovery priorities, and 
        more. We’ll also examine a disaster recovery plan template adaptable for your organization.

        Every threat hunt, every incident response, and every bulletin from your ISAC comes with a wealth 
        of intelligence that you can leverage to spot suspicious or malicious activity in the future. The 
        process of taking that information and turning it into reliable, repeatable alerting is known as 
        Detection Engineering. In this talk I will demo the free and open Security Onion platform, the 
        methods by which it can generate or ingest logs about your environment, and how we can use that 
        log data to trigger alerts for potential incidents. Whether you're looking for artifacts in network 
        traffic, file structures, or endpoint logs, it's easy to create new detection rules so your analysts 
        are aware when something suspicious rears its head.

        Recent studies have shown that the average enterprise has over 50 different tools and 
        services to manage, monitor, and secure their enterprise networks and data.  Often times, 
        these tools are from a wide variety of manufacturers and service providers, and they lack 
        native integration with one another.  Manual integration can be achieved, but it is costly 
        and complex.  A lack of integration leads to gaps in information during an attack, when 
        clear and concise information is critical, and minutes can cost millions.

        Fortinet has the widest variety of cybersecurity solutions in the market today, and we have 
        been integrating them into our Security Fabric for over 15 years.  Come see how we can

    - title: "Intro to Hybrid Cloud Physical Security"
      abstract: >
        Physical security has long been hindered by the limitations of on-premise DVR/NVR systems—complex 
        maintenance, siloed devices, and lack of remote access. Verkada introduces a new approach: a 
        hybrid cloud platform that combines the reliability of onboard storage with the accessibility and 
        scalability of the cloud. In this session, we’ll explore how Verkada unifies video security, 
        access control, sensors, alarms, and intercom under a single, easy-to-use interface. Attendees 
        will learn how organizations across industries are modernizing security operations with real-time 
        insights, seamless remote access, and simplified total cost of ownership.

    - title: "Choose Your Own Security Adventure: Navigating the Nightmare of Modern Threats"
      presenter: Troels Emil Hojlund-Rasmussen
      abstract: >
        Step into a chilling, interactive cybersecurity experience where every decision could mean the 
        difference between containment and catastrophe. In this session, attendees will follow the 
        journey of Sarah, a junior security analyst, as she uncovers a vulnerability that spirals into 
        a full-blown ransomware attack. Through branching decision points, participants will explore 
        the consequences of common security choices — from quarantine protocols and ticketing delays 
        to backup misconfigurations and BYOD risks.

        This immersive “choose-your-own-adventure” format highlights how small missteps can compound 
        into major breaches, and how layered security, policy enforcement, and incident response 
        readiness are critical to survival. Attendees will encounter a rogues’ gallery of IT monsters 
        — from unmanaged devices and shadow IT to credential abuse and backup sabotage — and learn how 
        to hunt them before they strike.

        Whether you're an MSP, IT leader, or security professional, this session will challenge your 
        instincts, expose hidden gaps in your security stack, and offer practical strategies to build 
        resilience against modern threats. Are you ready to enter the nightmare?

      abstract: >
        Traditional perimeter-based defenses can’t keep pace in today’s cloud-native, AI-driven landscape. 
        This session introduces Cyber Risk Exposure Management (CREM) and its role in transforming how 
        organizations identify, quantify, and prioritize threats. Learn how Trend Micro Vision One 
        integrates AI not only for detection, but also for risk scoring, prediction, and proactive response. 
        We’ll explore how CREM translates technical exposure into business impact, guiding smarter resource 
        allocation and executive-level decision making. See how AI-driven forecasting of likely attack paths 
        enables security teams to stay ahead of adversaries, strengthen resilience, and demonstrate measurable 
        value to the business.

    - title: "The Browser is the New Perimeter: Why Defenders Must Rethink Identity-First Security"
      presenter: Scott Bryant
      abstract: >
        The browser has become the new enterprise perimeter. It’s where employees access cloud apps, move 
        data, and get work done — yet it remains one of the most under-defended layers in security. 
        Traditional tools weren’t built to see or control what happens inside the browser, creating a 
        blind spot attackers are actively exploiting. Today’s adversaries aren’t hacking in — they’re 
        logging in. By phishing credentials, stealing tokens, or hijacking sessions, attackers can slip 
        into apps through the browser and move quickly to sensitive systems, admin panels, and data 
        stores — no malware required. AI-driven phishing and shadow SaaS adoption only expand the attack 
        surface, while real-time attacks often finish before legacy monitoring tools can even react. 
        This session will explore how defenders can reframe their approach, treating the browser as the 
        new endpoint, to detect and stop identity-driven attacks before they become costly breaches.
