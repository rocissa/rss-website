    - title: "When AI Walks Through the Front Door: Using Artificial Intelligence for Physical Social Engineering"
      presenter: Steve Stasiukonis
      abstract: >
        AI made breaking into a secure data center a lot less like "Mission: Impossible" and more like "Mission: 
        Improbably Easy." We used an AI tool to gather public information (OSINT) from all over the internet. 
        When sensitive information is entered into AI systems—especially public or third-party platforms—it 
        stops being just your private data and quietly becomes shared or "cooperatively private" data.  My 
        session will step you through the scenario of how this intelligence was used to compromise a highly 
        secure facility. The session is informative while also carries a lot of humor.

      presenter: Dr. Marcus L. Green
      abstract: >
        Human insider threats continue to increase as computer systems become more widespread. Most studies of cybersecurity risks and resilience efforts focus on technological solutions; however, many of the costliest cybersecurity events originated from human risk factors. This novel, study was designed to identify drivers of human factor insider threats. Qualitative data were collected from 15 cybersecurity experts. A grounded theory coding process generated dominant factors related to drivers and solutions of insider threats, leading to the development of a Human Insider Threat (HIT) conceptual framework. The framework has practical implications for managers to assess vulnerabilities and for researchers to develop scalable instruments.

        Every threat hunt, every incident response, and every bulletin from your ISAC comes with a wealth 
        of intelligence that you can leverage to spot suspicious or malicious activity in the future. The 
        process of taking that information and turning it into reliable, repeatable alerting is known as 
        Detection Engineering. In this talk I will demo the free and open Security Onion platform, the 
        methods by which it can generate or ingest logs about your environment, and how we can use that 
        log data to trigger alerts for potential incidents. Whether you're looking for artifacts in network 
        traffic, file structures, or endpoint logs, it's easy to create new detection rules so your analysts 
        are aware when something suspicious rears its head.

    - title: "Building a Security Program - No Borders, No Bias, No BS"
      presenter: Rob Preta
      abstract: >
        - Moving beyond the traditional "Castle and Moat":  Organizations now use cloud services, SaaS applications, and have employees working from anywhere on any device. This means the attack surface is everywhere, not just at the network edge.<br>
        
        - A Vendor-Neutral, Technology-First approach: Vendor bias can significantly hinder a cybersecurity program. When a single vendor's solutions are adopted across the board, it can lead to vendor lock-in, limited flexibility, and a lack of best-of-breed solutions.<br>
        
        - Measuring & Maturing the program: To build a sustainable cybersecurity program, you can't just buy a product and call it a day. The program needs to be a continuous process of improvement.

    - title: "Vendor Consolidation: Get Your Tools and Teams Pulling in the Same Direction"
      presenter: Mark Rosenecker
      abstract: >
        Recent studies have shown that the average enterprise has over 50 different tools and 
        services to manage, monitor, and secure their enterprise networks and data.  Often times, 
        these tools are from a wide variety of manufacturers and service providers, and they lack 
        native integration with one another.  Manual integration can be achieved, but it is costly 
        and complex.  A lack of integration leads to gaps in information during an attack, when 
        clear and concise information is critical, and minutes can cost millions.<br><br>
        
        Fortinet has the widest variety of cybersecurity solutions in the market today, and we have 
        been integrating them into our Security Fabric for over 15 years.  Come see how we can 
        streamline your security operations; lowering both capital and operational cost, while 
        improving your security posture at the same time.

      abstract: >
        Step into a chilling, interactive cybersecurity experience where every decision could mean the 
        difference between containment and catastrophe. In this session, attendees will follow the 
        journey of Sarah, a junior security analyst, as she uncovers a vulnerability that spirals into 
        a full-blown ransomware attack. Through branching decision points, participants will explore 
        the consequences of common security choices — from quarantine protocols and ticketing delays 
        to backup misconfigurations and BYOD risks.<br><br>
        
        This immersive “choose-your-own-adventure” format highlights how small missteps can compound 
        into major breaches, and how layered security, policy enforcement, and incident response 
        readiness are critical to survival. Attendees will encounter a rogues’ gallery of IT monsters 
        — from unmanaged devices and shadow IT to credential abuse and backup sabotage — and learn how 
        to hunt them before they strike.<br><br>
        
        Whether you're an MSP, IT leader, or security professional, this session will challenge your 
        instincts, expose hidden gaps in your security stack, and offer practical strategies to build 
        resilience against modern threats. Are you ready to enter the nightmare?

    - title: "The Browser is the New Perimeter: Why Defenders Must Rethink Identity-First Security"
      presenter: Mark Orlando
      abstract: >
        The browser has become the new enterprise perimeter. It’s where employees access cloud apps, move 
        data, and get work done — yet it remains one of the most under-defended layers in security. 
        Traditional tools weren’t built to see or control what happens inside the browser, creating a 
        blind spot attackers are actively exploiting. Today’s adversaries aren’t hacking in — they’re 
        logging in. By phishing credentials, stealing tokens, or hijacking sessions, attackers can slip 
        into apps through the browser and move quickly to sensitive systems, admin panels, and data 
        stores — no malware required. AI-driven phishing and shadow SaaS adoption only expand the attack 
        surface, while real-time attacks often finish before legacy monitoring tools can even react. 
        This session will explore how defenders can reframe their approach, treating the browser as the 
        new endpoint, to detect and stop identity-driven attacks before they become costly breaches.
