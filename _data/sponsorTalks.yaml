    Title: Check your cyber ego at the door - Striking the vital balance between confidence and arrogance
    Abstract: "Even setting foot on a field of battle, whether for team sports or military purposes, requires extreme self-confidence.  If you don't believe you can win, you very likely won't.  In the war against cyber crime, however, it's important to balance that confidence with the understanding that this is also a team sport - and that none of us can win alone.  Join us for a discussion on navigating the line between confidence and arrogance - and knowing when and how to seek and accept help from others."

    Title: Reshaping The Enterprise Security Landscape - The Modern Design
    Abstract: "IT professionals and cybersecurity practitioners face immense challenges adapting to shifts in the desired work models employed by users and their organizations. According to recent Gartners' research*, 'Enterprise browsers will evolve to become the core platform for almost all of the day-to-day enterprise productivity and security software used by the workforce.' Traditional architectural approaches are quite limited in such areas as BYOD programs, contractor/third-party provisioning, hybrid work, and modernization efforts. What if solutions to many of these difficult challenges could be solved by reimagining the browser as a core component of enterprise architecture?\n\nIn this session, Island will provide examples on how this new category and technology:\n-Revolutionizes your organization, enabling you to address modern work challenges while unlocking new opportunities.\n-Streamlines BYOD, contractor/third-party, and hybrid work initiatives with innovative architectural approaches\n-Implements novel security measures to safeguard organizational applications and data"

    Title: XDR in Action - The Blueprint for Holistic Visibility and Automated Response
    Abstract: "Traditional security information and event management (SIEM) solutions can't detect cyberattacks that span multiple security layers, making them difficult to resolve.\nExtended Detection and Response (XDR) is the natural evolution from EDR to expand coverage and protect against sophisticated attackers. This session covers how XDR provides security teams greater visibility so informed decisions on where to invest time and resources can be made.\nLearn how XDR's use of APIs, AI, and ML for automatic threat investigation and correlation differs from traditional SIEM systems. See a demo showcasing how ProArch's SOC leverages Microsoft Defender XDR for automatic resolution and cross-product threat hunting.
